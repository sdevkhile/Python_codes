### Have the function LetterCountI(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the first word with the greatest number of repeated letters. 
For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. 
If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. Words will be separated by spaces. ###

def wordcount(str1):
    x = str1.lower().split()
    result = None
    max_count=0
    for word in x:
        word_count={}
        for letter in word:
            if letter in word_count:
                word_count[letter]= word_count[letter] +1
            else:
                word_count[letter] = 1
        max_value = max(word_count.values())
        desired_word = word
        
        if max_value> max_count:
            max_count=max_value
            result = desired_word
        else:
            return -1
    print(result)
